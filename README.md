Angular ensures a responsive and dynamic user interface, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with their stored payment cards. The use of .NET 8 MVC architecture helps in structuring the application logic, separating concerns, and facilitating seamless communication between frontend and backend components.

With Entity Framework, CardEase stores payment card details in a database, ensuring data integrity. Users can  add, edit, and delete payment cards.
