# CardEase

CardEase is a web application designed to securely manage payment cards, built using Angular for the frontend and .NET 7 MVC with Entity Framework for the backend. It provides users with a convenient platform to store and organize their payment card information.

Angular ensures a responsive and dynamic user interface, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with their stored payment cards. The use of .NET 7 MVC architecture helps in structuring the application logic, separating concerns, and facilitating seamless communication between frontend and backend components.

With Entity Framework, CardEase securely stores payment card details in a database, ensuring data integrity and privacy. Users can securely add, edit, and delete payment cards, as well as perform other account management tasks.
